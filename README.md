# Ginie - Infra as a Conversation

"Ginie" is a powerful infrastructure management tool designed to streamline and automate the deployment, configuration, and maintenance of cloud-based infrastructure. It empowers developers, system administrators, and DevOps teams to manage their infrastructure efficiently through a simple and intuitive conversation.

### Proof of Concept

Current version uses ChatGPT's gpt-3.5-turbo as the underlying AI model. It can be replaced with any model that has latest knowledge on terraform and their provider documentation.

It uses terraform behind the scenes to deploy and destroy your infrastructure.
